# Computer Vision (PS)

## News / Important dates

- We will start the PS on **Oct. 2, 2019 (10:30-11:30am, T03)**

## Grading

Grading is based on bi-weekly programming assignments, where we will successively implement **all** parts of a pipeline to solve an image recognition task. All these parts have assigned points and the final grade is based on the sum of all the acquired points.

Once an exercise is completed, I will provide one possible solution which will serve as the basis for implementing the next part, and so on.

Depending on the
number of students signed up for the course, you will either work alone or
in groups (of max. size 3). This will be decided once the PS starts.
