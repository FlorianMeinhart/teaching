This is my **main repository** where I host teaching material for students.
As of winter term 2017/2018, all the teaching material for the courses that I
teach can be found here (e.g., links to external resources, exercise sheets, gists, etc.).

For some courses, the teaching language is German, for some it's English.
This is also reflected in the material, so do not expect consistency.
