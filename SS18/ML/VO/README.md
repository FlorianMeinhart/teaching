# Machine Learning (VO)

## News / Important dates

- The course starts on Mar. 07, 2018 (9am-11am)

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course (typically in the last lecture).

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be discussed on the basis of
my slides. If something is **not** on my slides (e.g., whiteboard notes, derivations, etc.),
I will provide references or online resources.

Please, always check the most recent versions (since updates might have occurred). I typically
update the slides after the lecture to clarify issues raised by the students.
