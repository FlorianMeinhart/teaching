# Computer Vision (VO)

## News / Important dates

- **Course begin**: Oct. 3, 2017 (2.30pm-4pm)

## Grading

Grading is based on one final exam at the end of the semester (typically the first date for the exam is the last lecture). The material for the exam is the content of the lecture slides and the additional material that we discuss during the lecture.

## Lecture material

- [Slides-00](cv_00.pdf)
- [Slides-01](cv_01.pdf)
- [Slides-02](cv_02.pdf)
- [Slides-03](cv_03.pdf)
- [Deep Learning Intro](DL-Intro.pdf)

The course will be more **interactive** this year, as much of the relevant material
has changed over the last years. In the first half of the course we will discuss
more *classic* approaches to problems in computer vision and will then shift
to more *recent* work on many topics. Mostly, the second part of the course
is focussed on *deep learning* approaches to recognition, segmentation and
detection and I will provide the relevant resources and papers below.
