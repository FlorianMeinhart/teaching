# Computer Vision (PS)

## News / Important dates

- Group membership: **Second** PS date
- The PS is held **bi-weekly** (see PLUS Online)

## Groups

You will work together in **groups of 3**. Please find your group members
let me know by the **second** PS date (this is a hard deadline).

## Grading

Grading is based on the exercise sheets. For a positive grad, you need to have
more than 50% of all possible points. The grades are then distributed linearly
up to the max. number of achievable points.

## Handing-in exercise sheets

Each exercise sheets needs to be handed-in in the form of a Jupyter notebook
(formerly known as IPython notebooks). Even if you do not complete all exercises
of one exercise sheet, hand in the notebook. The filename of the notebook needs
to be in the form `GROUPNAME_ExSheet_X.ipynb`.

### Recommendation

I do recommend to use Anaconda Python. For Mac/Linux/Windows, download the
Anaconda installer from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow
the installation instructions. To check your installation, you can try to
start the Python interpreter and load `skimage` and `sklearn` (which come
as part of the Anaconda installation). E.g.,

```bash
python
>> import skimage
```
If this works, your are all set. To start a Jupyter notebook, run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
In general, a browser window should open and you should be able to create
a new Jupyter notebook, rename it and work with it. In principle, this gives
you an interactive Python environement that is (1) perfect to learn Python
and (2) complete all the exercises. *I will demonstrate this pipleline at
the first PS date!*
