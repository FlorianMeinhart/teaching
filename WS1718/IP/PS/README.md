# Image Processing / Grundlagen Bildverarbeitung (PS)

## News / Important dates

- **The PS has ended**
- Submission system online, click [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/)
- Group membership: Deadline **Oct. 16, 2017**

## Groups

You will work together in **groups of 3**. Please find your group members let me know
by **Oct. 16, 2017** (this is a **hard** deadline).

## Grading

Grading is based on your solutions to the exercise sheets. The deadline to
hand-in the exercise sheets will be listed next to the exercise sheet links
(see below). For a positive grade, you need to have
more than 50% of all possible points. The grades are then distributed linearly
up to the max. number of achievable points (excluding the bonus points).

*All* group members will get the same grade, except for cases where it is
obvious that group members did not participate to the required extent.

## What happens in the PS?

At each PS date, we will discuss your solutions to the exercise sheet
that was due on that day. I will, from time to time, also go through
implementations (and tricks) of some of the algorithms that we discuss
in the lecture and also give some hints on how to solve the exercises from
the upcoming sheet. **Note**: Attendance of the PS is **mandatory**.

## Handing-in exercise sheets

Each exercise sheet needs to be handed-in in the form of a Jupyter notebook
(formerly known as IPython notebooks). Even if you do not complete all exercises
of one exercise sheet, hand in the notebook. The filename of the notebook needs
to be in the form `GROUPNAME_ExSheet_X.ipynb`.

**Submission system**: Submit your exercise solutions [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/)

### Recommendation

I do recommend to use Anaconda Python. For Mac/Linux/Windows, download the
Anaconda installer from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow
the installation instructions. To check your installation, you can try to
start the Python interpreter and load `skimage` and `sklearn` (which come
as part of the Anaconda installation). E.g.,

```bash
python
>> import skimage
```
If this works, your are all set. To start a Jupyter notebook, run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
In general, a browser window should open and you should be able to create
a new Jupyter notebook, rename it and work with it. In principle, this gives
you an interactive Python environement that is (1) perfect to learn Python
and (2) complete all the exercises. *I will demonstrate this pipleline at
the first PS date!*
