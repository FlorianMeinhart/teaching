# Exercise sheet 4

## Exercise 4.1

Write a Python function that performs smoothing (with a Gaussian kernel)
in the Fourier domain. To see the effect of smoothing
in the frequency domain clearly, we will run
this on an artificial 40 x 40 black image with a 10 x 10
white block in the middle, generated by:

```python
def generate_square():
  sq = np.zeros((40,40))
  sq[15:25,15:25] = 1
  return sq
```

Your function should look something like this:

```python
def frequency_smoothing(img, sigma):
  # your code goes here
  return smoothed_image

```
Here, `img` denotes the grayscale image and
`sigma` specifies the width of the (isotropic) Gaussian
in the frequency domain.

In your Jupyter notebook you should:
1. Write the `frequency_smooth` function
2. Visualize the spectrum of the image *before* smoothing
3. Visualize the spectrum of the image *after* smoothing
4. Visualize the smoothed image
5. (Bonus) Implement a non-isotropic Gaussian and visualize some results

To compute the 2D FFT, look at the `numpy.fft` package.
