# Image Processing / Grundlagen Bildverarbeitung

In the *Image Processing* course (VO), you will learn about fundamental
image processing concepts, such as image acquisition and representation,
image enhancement, image restauration, edge detection, segmentation and
morphological image processing.

In the corresponding PS, you will learn how to implement
many of the algorithms and image processing routines that we discuss in the
lecture. This ranges from simple histogram equalization to Fourier transforms,
Wavelet transforms and morphological operations.
