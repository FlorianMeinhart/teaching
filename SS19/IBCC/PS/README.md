# Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras (PS)

## News

- [04/17/19] The submission system work now (starting with Ex. sheet C)

## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. You can select that you want to solve. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in
by the deadline(s) given below.

Each exercise has a specific value (in points) and you have to have at least half of the total sum of the points of all exercises for a positive grade. However, I will also take the type of solution strategy into account. Also, if someone has a good idea but a wrong solution, this will be taken into account.

**Note**: All exercise sheets have to be handed in online [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/).

When you want to log-in for the first time, you have to reset your password using your “Matrikelnummer” as a user name. All group members can potentially upload material for their group.
