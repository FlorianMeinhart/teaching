# Computer Vision (PS)

## News / Important dates

- The PS will start in **Oct. 2018**

## Groups

You will work together in **groups of 3**. Please find your group members let
me know by **tba** (this is a **hard** deadline).

## Grading

Grading is based on your solutions to the exercise sheets. The deadline to
hand-in the exercise sheets will be listed next to the exercise sheet links
(see below). For a positive grade, you need to have
more than 50% of all possible points. The grades are then distributed linearly
up to the max. number of achievable points (excluding the bonus points).

*All* group members will get the same grade, except for cases where it is
obvious that group members did not participate to the required extent.
