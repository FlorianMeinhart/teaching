# Machine Learning

The course provides a graduate-level introduction to machine learning theory and algorithms and is largely motivated by Shai Shalev-Schwartzâ€™s course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (see links below). The topics include, but are not limited to, the PAC learning framework, VC dimension, linear predictors, boosting, support vector machines, kernel methods, nearest-neighbor methods and selected topics from deep learning.
